# BIM5D Application
- <strong>BIM5D is a project which is the application to support Civil Engineer in quantity construction calculation and cost estimation. </strong>
- Simply understanding, in the AEC (Architectural Engineering and Construction) industry, I have a building, I have to know quantities of everything (concrete, tiles, ceiling, rebar, brick ... etc)
Then, I calculate the cost estimate of that building.

- It's written by Revit API, C# (OOP, winforms), SQL, VBScript.
<h4>The application includes 3 main part: </h4>
<strong>
<ul>
<li>1. bim5d software: Core, this part calculates all elements of the building, contains algorithm, rules, calculation (https://github.com/kanechan25/bim5d_software)</li>
<li>2. bim5d add-in: Add-in attaches to Autodesk Software, supports throughout the building modeling process (https://github.com/kanechan25/bim5d_addin)</li>
<li>3. bim5d database management: arranges, backup, saves all components database of BIM technologist (https://github.com/kanechan25/bim5d_database_management)</li>
</ul>
</strong>

<h3>This repo is BIM5D Add-in: </h3>

&nbsp;
### And software operates as below:
- This is UI of Revit software. I built add-in attaching to Autodesk Software.
- I can interact with the building model, edit, create, delete information of every/all elements of the model.

- After that, upper tools export files such as json, csv, xlsx... 
- I use them as meterials to go to <strong> bim5d software.</strong>

- Hoping it support you a bit in your work!
